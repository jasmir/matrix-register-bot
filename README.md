This bot provides a two-step-registration for matrix ([synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse)).

This is done in several steps:
- potential new user registers on a bot-provided site
- user has to verify its mail address
- bot sends a message to predefined room with a registration notification.
- users in that room now can approve or decline the registration.
- When approved
  - the bot creates short time credentials
  - sends them to the user
  - stores them encrypted in own databas or uses that as initial password for registration

To configure synapse so that the users can login that were created via this bot you can either 
- set `operationMode=synapse` so the bot uses the register api to push the new users to synapse or 
- integrate it via [matrix-synapse-rest-auth](https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-synapse-rest-auth#integrate) by configuring your system to point at `internal/login.php`.

When using `operationMode=local` you can have the following benefits (some require [mxisd](https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd/blob/master/docs/stores/rest.md))
- Automatically set the display name based on first and last name on first login
- Use the 3PID lookup for other users (only email)
- Search for users that you have not seen yet

## Requirements

- Working PHP environment with
  - database connection provider \[one of sqlite, mysql, postgres\]
  - curl extension to notify admins and register users (in `operationMode=synapse`)
  - mail capability to interact with the users (Verification, Approval (+ initial password), Notifications)
- matrix-synapse-rest-auth when using `operationMode=local`
- some PHP capable webserver which makes the folder `public` accessible to the public and propably `internal` for server-internal access

## How to install

- Copy `config.sample.php` to `config.php` and configure the bot as you can find there
- Create config.json in the install directory and make it writeable by webserver (touch config.json && chmod 0666 config.json)
- Configure your webserver to have the folder `public` accessible via web.
  The folder `internal` contains files that only provide API access. They can be accessed by mxisd or matrix-synapse-rest-auth 
- To integrate with [matrix-synapse-rest-auth](https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-synapse-rest-auth):
  - `/_matrix-internal/identity/v1/check_credentials` should map to `internal/login.php`
- To integrate with [mxisd](https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd): Have a look at [the docs of mxisd](https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd/blob/master/docs/stores/rest.md) and apply as follows:


| Key                            | file which handles that       | Description                                          |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| rest.endpoints.auth            | internal/login.php            | Validate credentials and get user profile            |
| rest.endpoints.directory       | internal/directory_search.php | Search for users by arbitrary input                  |
| rest.endpoints.identity.single | internal/identity_single.php  | Endpoint to query a single 3PID                      |
| rest.endpoints.identity.bulk   | internal/identity_bulk.php    | Endpoint to query a list of 3PID                     |


## Further notes:

### Security: Passwords from registration form are stored in clear text
Currently the passwords which are typed in while capturing the register request are stored in clear text.
The bot needs to access them to trigger a register request with correct credentials.
It is currently strongly recommended to set `"getPasswordOnRegistration" => false` in your config!
This leads to autocreating passwords which will then be send to the users directly without storing it.

### Use the ChangePasswortInterceptor (if `operationMode=local`)

To allow users to change their pasword you need a reverse proxy which maps `/_matrix/client/r0/account/password` to `internal/intercept_change_password.php`.
Here is an example for nginx:
```
        location /_matrix/client/r0/account/password {
                proxy_pass http://localhost/mxbot/internal/intercept_change_password.php;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        }
```
### The bot postpones some actions
There is a cron.php which implements retries and database cleanups (e.g. to remove a username claim)
For this run cron.php regularly with your system of choice.
